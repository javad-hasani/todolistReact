## What I Learned

In the process of building my first React project, I gained valuable insights and skills:

- **React Fundamentals:** I grasped the fundamental concepts of React, such as components, state, and props, which formed the backbone of my application.

- **State Management:** I explored state management in React using Redux Toolkit, enabling me to efficiently manage and update the application's data.

- **Modular CSS:** I adopted modular CSS, a new approach that allowed me to create well-structured and maintainable styles for my components, enhancing code organization and reusability.

- **UI/UX Design:** I ventured into UI/UX design principles, striving to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface for the app.

Building this Todo app marked a significant step in my React journey, and I'm excited to continue learning and applying my newfound knowledge to future endeavors.
